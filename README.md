# KissAs3Dm
Demo applications to demonstrate KissAs3Fw.

Based on and built with the fully supported Harman AirSDK (previously Adobe AirSDK).

This is not like flex: does not use mxml documents - apps have to be programmed, even the displaying of the user interface.
But it will be simple and the developer wins the almost perfect control over its objects (as expectable)!

Android, iPhone, desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux) versions will are published:
- iPhone (ipa): available only to developer, sorry
- Android (apk): https://www.kisscodesystems.com/apk/kissfdtest/
- Windows (zip): https://www.kisscodesystems.com/zip/windows/kissfdtest/
- MacOS (zip): https://www.kisscodesystems.com/zip/macos/kissfdtest/
- Linux (zip): https://www.kisscodesystems.com/zip/linux/kissfdtest/
